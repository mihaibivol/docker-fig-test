# Description
#
# Two web apps: web1 and web2 use a common redis instance
# they are routed to the web in an nginx server

# Frontend exposing on localhost:8000 webapps 1 and 2
# go to localhost:8000/app1 to see the entry count
# go to locahlost:8000/app2 to see the entry count
#
# To reset the counter for a specific service run:
# sudo fig run web(1|2) ./common/resetCounter.py
# notice how the script code is not duplicated but it reads the config in
# each of the apps
